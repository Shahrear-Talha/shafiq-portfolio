                I have dedicated myself to the field of law, using my expertise to promote justice and equality. My
                journey
                began in the UK, where I earned my law degree from a prestigious university and began my legal career
                quickly realized that I was most passionate about using my legal skills to help those who were most
                vulnerable and marginalized. I began working with a variety of legal aid organizations, providing free
                legal services to those who could not afford them.

                There are more than 820 million people in the world who are chronically hungry. Most live in sub-Saharan
                Africa, southern Asia, and Latin America.

                Trying to produce enough food to keep up with the ever-increasing global population is probably
                agriculture’s biggest challenge. By 2030 an additional two billion people will need to be fed, using the
                same fragile land and water resources that we have now.

                    Working in Agribusiness has brought me a sense of peace and fulfillment like no other. Every day, I
                    am reminded of the incredible power and beauty of nature, and the importance of our relationship
                    with it. Amidst all the hard work and long hours, there is a profound sense of joy and satisfaction
                    in knowing that we are making a positive impact on the world around us.
